Hardware Ordered

Push Buttons (12V/24V, 3A, Blue Ring LED) → For mode selection (3 buttons = 3 modes).

Rocker Switch (12V/24V, 20A, LED) → For main power ON/OFF.

⚠️ Note: Later corrected that mode buttons should be 5V, not 12V, to avoid extra circuitry.
✅ ON/OFF rocker switch is fine at 12V.

Mode Selection

3 buttons = 3 modes.

Pressing a button selects that mode (momentary input only).

Future upgrade: LEDs on buttons to indicate selected mode.

System Logic

Humidity Control:

If humidity drops below setpoint X → humidifier & air pump turn ON.

Once humidity reaches Z → they turn OFF.

CO₂ Control:

If CO₂ > threshold (2000–3000 ppm) → relay triggers.

Bug fixed: previously values above 1000ppm displayed incorrectly (e.g., 850 → 8500).

Display

Using LCD / Nextion display.

RTC library initially caused issues → switched to Arduino Nano IoT (has built-in clock).

LCD backlight works, but readings required debugging (fixed in revised code).

Sensors & Issues

Temperature sensor was faulty → replaced with DHT11.

Wrong values disturbed interface until sensor was replaced.

Revised schematics provided with smaller breadboard layout.

RTC module no longer needed with Nano IoT.

Current Status

Modes register correctly.
